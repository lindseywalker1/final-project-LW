## EPI 590R Final Project

This dataset "Top 50 Spotify Songs- 2019" was collected from Kaggle, an online community platform supplying publicly available datasets under Google LLC (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/leonardopena/top50spotify2019).

The 50 songs are listed with their associated characteristics: genre, beats per minute, energy, valence, danceability, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, and popularity. The beats per minute refers to the tempo of the song; the energy and valence variables are directly related to the energy and positivity of the song, the higher the value the more energetic and positive the song. The higher the danceability of a song the easier it is to dance along; a high value of speechiness means the song contains more spoken word. Acousticness is rated on how much of the song is made by acoustics, the liveness is how likely the song is a live recording, and popularity refers to how well the song is enjoyed by people around the world.

## Descriptive Statistics

Table 1 describes the average beats per minute, energy, liveness, danceability, valence, length, acousticness, speechiness, popularity of the top 50 songs from Spotify in 2019, stratified by genre.

data1 <- read_csv("/Users/lindseywalker/Documents/Documents/Documents/Documents/RSPH/FALL 2023/EPI590R/final-project-LW/data/top50.csv")
library(dplyr)

music <- data1 |> select(Beats.Per.Minute, Energy, Liveness, Danceability, Valence., Length., Acousticness.., Speechiness., Popularity, Genre)

library(gtsummary)

tbl1 <- tbl_summary(

                           "stat_15", "stat_16", "stat_17", "stat_18", "stat_19", "stat_20", "stat_21") 
                         ~ "**Music Genre, n=50**") |>
  add_overall() 
tbl1
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
pan_pop <- inline_text(tbl1, variable = "Beats.Per.Minute", column = "panamanian pop")
can_pop <- inline_text(tbl1, variable = "Beats.Per.Minute", column = "canadian pop")

```

Distribution of the continuous outcome: beats per minute:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-hist
#| fig-cap: Distribution of beats per minute 
hist(music$Beats.Per.Minute)

# create inline stats to then report in the manuscript
mean <- list(n=nrow(music),
             mean_bpm = mean(music$Beats.Per.Minute))


```

There were `r mean$n` songs with a mean of `r mean$mean_bpm` per minute. @fig-hist shows the majority of songs have 80-100 beats per minute.

## Regression

Two models were created to analyze relationships between a song's beats per minutes and various characteristics

```         
Music Composure Model: Acousticness, speechiness, liveness and length

Music Interpretation Model: Danceability, popularity, energy, valence, and length
```

```{r}
#| echo: false

# create linear regression models with Beats per minute as continuous outcome
  # this model: looking at music characteristics that have to do with how 
    #the music is composed: acousticness, speechiness, liveness, length
linear_model <- lm(Beats.Per.Minute ~ Liveness + Acousticness.. + Speechiness. + Length.,
                   data = music)  
tbl_composed <- tbl_regression(
  linear_model,
  intercept = TRUE
)

#this model looks at music characteristics that have to do with how the sound 
    #is interpretted: danceability, popularity, 
linear_model2 <- lm(Beats.Per.Minute ~ Danceability + Popularity + Energy + Valence. + Length.,
                    data = music)
tbl_interp <- tbl_regression(
  linear_model2,
  intercept = TRUE
)

# combined the 2 linear regerssion models and create well formatted regression table
#| label: tbl-reg
#| tbl-cap: Regression 
tblreg <- tbl_merge(list(tbl_composed, tbl_interp),
          tab_spanner = c("**Music Composure Model**", "**Music Interpretation Model**"))
tblreg

```

## Results

The musical genre Panamanian Pop has, on average, higher beats per minute (`r pan_pop`) bpmthan Canadian Pop (`r can_pop`) bmp.

According to the regression results, there are no clear associations between beats per minute and the musical characteristics liveness, acousticness, speechiness, length, danceability, popularity, energy, and valence. Table 2 reports the p-values of each of the variables in the regression model. There are no statistically significant results.
